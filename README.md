## Data Structures and Algorithms - Course project | Autumn 2022

In this project I created a hash table that utilizes open hashing. Each slot of the hash table contains a linked list structure to store multiple keys to a specific slot. The idea of this project was to implement the structure in a way that it could store large amounts of data with a low time consumption. More details about the implemented structure and the results available in my [report](https://github.com/ToniKoskinen/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Course-Project/blob/main/DSA%20Practical%20Assignment.pdf).
